You can install QCRG Scoreboard by clicking the install badge to the left.  This
will install a compatible version of Adobe AIR, if necessary, and the scoreboard
software itself.

In order to remove QCRG Scoreboard from your system, click the install badge at
left, open the AIR file, and choose Uninstall.


Updates
-------

By default, QCRG Scoreboard will check to see if a newer stable version is
available when you start the application.  If you go into the
Preferences or Settings dialog box, you can turn off automatic checking,
check manually, or change your preferred release track.  The release track you
choose will determine which update notifications you receive:

- **stable** _(default):_ These releases have been tested on all supported
  platforms, and have performed satisfactorily in at least one regulation bout
  or scrimmage.  Due to the greater level of testing, this release track lags in
  features.
- **unstable:** These are candidates for the stable release track which have
  been tested on all supported platforms, but have not yet been used at a
  regulation bout or scrimmage.  New features show up on this release track
  first when they are ready for prime-time.
- **development:** Russian roulette with five in the chamber.
- **others:** Other release tracks will show up in the menu from time to time.
  You should not use these unless specifically instructed to do so by a
  developer.
