------------------------------------------------

*POÄNG is under active development,* though it is not quite ready for prime
time.  For production use, [QCRG Scoreboard 2][] is still recommended.
Please visit the [Google Group][] to get support from the developers and other
users.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

POÄNG is tested and supported on the following platforms:

- Mac OS X v10.6 "Snow Leopard," 64-bit Intel
- Windows 7 Professional, 32-bit Intel
- Ubuntu Linux 10.10 "Maverick Meerkat," 32-bit Intel

It is expected to run satisfactorily on any of the [supported desktop

Installation
------------

There is a one-click installer for POÄNG on the [project home page][]. This will
install a compatible version of Adobe AIR, if necessary, and the scoreboard
software itself.

In order to remove POÄNG from your system, click the install badge on the [project home page][], open the AIR file, and choose Uninstall.

Updates
-------

By default, POÄNG will check to see if a newer stable version is available when
you start the application.  If you go into the Preferences or Settings dialog
box, you can turn off automatic checking, check manually, or change your
preferred release track.  The release track you choose will determine which
update notifications you receive:

- **stable** _(default):_ These releases have been tested on all supported
  platforms, and have performed satisfactorily in at least one regulation bout
  or scrimmage.  Due to the greater level of testing, this release track lags in
  features.
- **unstable:** These are candidates for the stable release track which have
  been tested on all supported platforms, but have not yet been used at a
  regulation bout or scrimmage.  New features show up on this release track
  first when they are ready for prime-time.
- **development:** Russian roulette with five in the chamber.
- **others:** Other release tracks will show up in the menu from time to time.
  You should not use these unless specifically instructed to do so by a
  developer.
