install a compatible version of Adobe AIR, if necessary, and the scoreboard
software itself.

Updates
-------

By default, POÄNG will check to see if a newer stable version is available when
you start the application.  If you go into the Preferences or Settings dialog
box, you can change your preferred release track.  The release track you choose
will determine which update notifications you receive:

- **stable** _(default):_ These releases have been tested on all supported
  platforms, and have performed satisfactorily in at least one regulation bout
  or scrimmage.  Due to the greater level of testing, this release track lags in
  features.
- **unstable:** These are candidates for the stable release track which have
  been tested on all supported platforms, but have not yet been used at a
  regulation bout or scrimmage.  New features show up on this release track
  first when they are ready for prime-time.
- **development:** Russian roulette with five in the chamber.
- **others:** Other release tracks will show up in the menu from time to time.
  You should not use these unless specifically instructed to do so by a
  developer.

"POÄNG is so great, you should sell it!"

POÄNG is free of charge, but I'm such a nice guy I'll let you buy it anyway.
